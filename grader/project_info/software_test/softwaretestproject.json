  "project_detail": "You are a cybersecurity specialist for a large oil and gas field services firm that frequently develops its own software. The company has over 150 locations globally and has outsourced a major portion of its IT and software development to India. All of these locations, including those in India, are on the same internal network for ease of access, even though many of them are contractors.You have been assigned the task of reviewing the project plan to ensure that all potential security issues have been identified and addressed prior to go-live.Application detailsThe purpose of the new application is to track the movement of all of the company’s trucks (semis) throughout the United States 24/7. Each truck will have a transponder that will report its location, speed, direction, and cargo (among other things). Users will be able to set a variety of filters based on what they’re looking for. The four main cargo types are all used in the hydraulic fracturing (aka “fracking”) process. They are wastewater, chemicals, explosives, and radioactive materials.The application will be hosted internally and will NOT be accessible via the Internet.However, any authenticated user on the internal network will be able to access it. A small number of employees will have admin privileges to it.Management is anxious to have this application go live so they can start saving money by making the routes more efficient. They see no issues with this application as it’s pretty simple in their eyes, so they are expecting you to provide the security approvals fairly quickly.The project plan calls for the company-approved SDLC process to be followed. At a high level, this means that there will be three environments: Development (“Dev”), QualityAssurance (“QA”), and Production (“Prod”)."
